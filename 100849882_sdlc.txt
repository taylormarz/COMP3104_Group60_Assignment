SDLC stands for Software Development Lifecycle. According to Techopedia, SLDC is a systematic
process for designing, developing, and testing software. It consists of a series of phases that
guide the project from start to finish.

There are seven stages throughout the SDLC, which are:

- Project Planning
- Gathering Requirements & Analysis
- Design
- Coding or Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Following the SDLC is a cost-effective and time-efficient way to design and build high-quality software.
