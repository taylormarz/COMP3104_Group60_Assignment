According to Atlassian, "DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophy
that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams."

The DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the processes, capabilities, and tools
needed for development and operations. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate
to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality.

The eight phases of the DevOps life cycle are:

- Discover
- Plan
- Build
- Test
- Deploy
- Operate
- Observe
- Continuous Feedback

There are many benefits to DevOps, as outlined in Atlassian's 2020 DevOps Trends Survey.
"99% of respondents said DevOps had a positive impact on their organization."

Some of the benefits that can be experienced through DevOps are:

- Speed
- Improved Collaboration
- Rapid Deployment
- Quality and Reliability
- Security

The challenges of adopting DevOps can be highlighted in a quote from Robert Krohn,
Head of Engineering, DevOps at Atlassian.

"DevOps isn't any single person's job. It's everyone's job."

Convincing teams to embrace an overhaul of their team structure, break habits, and stop 
working in silos are the biggest challenges organizations face when trying to transition
to DevOps.
