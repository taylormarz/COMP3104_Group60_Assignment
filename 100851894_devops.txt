Our instructor this semester for this course will be Professor Pritesh Patel. I have the honour of being in a group with Taylor, Ethan, and Amanda.
Furthermore, our success will hinge on three things within this course: 
1. Lab and lecture attendance
2. Completion of lecture quizzes
3. Following weekly lab exercises
