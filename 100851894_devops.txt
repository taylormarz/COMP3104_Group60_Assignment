Our instructor this semester for this course will be Professor Pritesh Patel. I have the honour of being in a group with Taylor, Ethan, and Amanda.
Furthermore, our success will hinge on three things within this course: 
1. Lab and lecture attendance
2. Completion of lecture quizzes
3. Following weekly lab exercises

One last thing to be mindful of is that there are no late submissions allowed.

The course code is COMP3104, not sure about the CRN though.
